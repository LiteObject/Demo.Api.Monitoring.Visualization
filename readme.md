# Monitoring, Tracing, Visualization... and more

## Prometheus vs Grafana: What's the main difference?
Prometheus is a monitoring solution for collection & storing time series data like metrics. 
Grafana allows to visualize the data stored in Prometheus (and other sources).

## What is OpenTelemetry?
>OpenTelemetry is a collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs. Use it to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) to help you analyze your software�s performance and behavior.

## How to setup Prometheus


## How to setup Grafana?
- Go to Grafana and add a new "Data Source"
  - Since both Grafana and Prometheus are in the docker, we can set the source URL to "http://host.docker.internal:30090"
